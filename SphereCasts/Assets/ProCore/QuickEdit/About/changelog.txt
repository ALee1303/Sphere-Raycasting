-- QuickEdit v1.5.0

# Bug Fixes
	- Recalculate collider dimensions on exiting edit mode. Fixed #59
	- Use a unique asset path when copying mesh data to the project. Fixed #63
	- Use a TRS class to store position, rotation, and scale of objects so that vertices are updated on all possible changes.  We get rotation support for free with this change - scale remains intransigent.
	- Remove no longer necessary VertHandlePrefab.  Don't use an if switch in OnDrawGizmos, instead, use the directives specifically designed for designating gizmos on selection / pickables.
